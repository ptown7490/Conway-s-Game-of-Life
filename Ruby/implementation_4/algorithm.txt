cell = pair of coordinates
world = list of all live cells
neighbors = set of delta vectors

iterate through generations
	display world
	associate #(live_neighbors) with each (member cell of world or a neighboring cell)
		count total occurance of each cell neighboring a live cell set that are in the world
			group all neighbor cells using delta vectors for each live cell and add to associating collection
	set next world with cells that occur in associate collection the right number of times


displaying world ==
	collect x_values in world
	collect y_values in world
	from min y_value to max y_value
		range from min x_value to max x_value
			print accordinly for whether resulting coordinate is in world
